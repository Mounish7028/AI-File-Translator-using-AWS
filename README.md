## **Overview**  
The AI File Translator Using AWS is a cloud-based application that enables users to upload text-based files and translate their content into different languages using AWS AI services. The project leverages AWS services such as Amazon Translate, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda to provide a seamless translation experience.  

## **Features**  
- Upload files in multiple formats (TXT, DOCX, PDF, etc.).  
- Automatic language detection.  
- Translation powered by **Amazon Translate**.  
- Secure storage using **Amazon S3**.  
- Serverless execution via **AWS Lambda**.  
- Scalable and cost-efficient cloud-based architecture.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **AWS Translate** – For text translation.  
- **AWS S3** – For file storage.  
- **AWS Lambda** – For serverless execution.  
- **Amazon Textract** (if needed) – For text extraction from images/PDFs.  
- **AWS API Gateway** – For API exposure.  
- **Python / Node.js** – For backend processing.  

## **Installation & Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-file-translator-aws.git
   cd ai-file-translator-aws
